	<content><![CDATA[The envelope address is the sender address of an e-mail server and is set by system admnistration by default.
	<br><br>
	<b>Important:</b> If you want to use your own envelope address, there must be a valid A-record in the Domain Name System (DNS) for the domain of the envelope address.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> If the Envelope-From address is to be processed directly by the bounce filter, an MX record must be stored in the DNS in addition to the A record, which refers to <b>the name of the filter service</b>. It must also be ensured that a bounce filter is stored in the EMM for the sender address.]]></content>
