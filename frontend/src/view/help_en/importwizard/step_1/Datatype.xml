	<content><![CDATA[The EMM currently supports two data formats for import. You can import either CSV files or JSON files.

For CSV data you can choose between several separators and import either with or without text recognition characters.
The header row contains the column labels and each record starts in a new row.

Example: You import two data records with the columns EMAIL, FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME, a semicolon is used as separator.
"email"; "firstname"; "lastname";
"tester1@example.com"; "test name1"; "testman1";
"tester2@example.com"; "test name2"; "testman2";

For JSON data, make sure that it is created as a JSON array of JSON objects. The structure is clearly defined.

Example: You import two data sets with the columns EMAIL, FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME

<pre>
[
	{
		"email": "tester1@example.com",
		"firstname": "Test name1",
		"lastname": "Testman1"
	},
	{
		"email": "tester2@example.com",
		"firstname": "Test name2",
		"lastname": "Testman2"
	}
]
</pre>
