This directory contains all libs used in EMM code (productive, testing, ...) 
migrated to JakartaEE.

To migrate libs, just run migrate-libs.sh.

(I know, that not all libraries use JEE classes, but for faster switching to JakartaEE
all libs are processed by the migration tool. Libs, that do not use JEE are not changed
by this tool.)


As long as code is compiled against Tomcat 9 runtime libraries, nothing must be changed.

After switching to Tomcat 10 runtime libraries, the libs in ${project-base}/lib/ and 
${project-base}/lib_testing/ must replaced by the corresponding files in 
${project-base}/lib_jakartaee/lib and ${project-base}/lib_jakartaee/lib_testing/.

Switching to Tomcat 10 also requires changes in the EMM source code:
Simply replace all occurances of
- "import jakarta.servlet" by "import jakarta.servlet" and
- "import jakarta.mail" by "import jakarta.mail"
